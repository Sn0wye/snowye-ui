import { Button } from '@snowye-ui/react';
import HeroContainer from '../../../components/HeroContainer';
import ButtonAdditionalStylingDemo from '../../../demos/ButtonAdditionalStylingDemo';

It is just like: "If you want something done right, do it by yourself".

Jokes aside, with Snowye UI you can extend the base components and customize them freely.

All components can receive a prop called `css` which receives an object containing the css properties you already know.

### Example

```tsx
<Button
  css={{
    background: '#00875f',
    '&:not(:disabled):hover': {
      background: '#015f43'
    }
  }}
>
  Hello World!
</Button>
```

### Result

<HeroContainer client:load>
  <ButtonAdditionalStylingDemo client:load />
</HeroContainer>
