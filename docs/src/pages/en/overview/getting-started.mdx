import { Button } from '@snowye-ui/react';
import HeroContainer from '../../../components/HeroContainer';

A quick tutorial on how to get up and running with Snowye UI

## Implementing a simple Button

### 1. Install Snowye UI

Install the Snowye UI from your command line

#### npm

```sh
# npm
npm install @snowye-ui/react

# yarn
yarn add @snowye-ui/react

# pnpm
pnpm i @snowye-ui/react
```

### 2. Use it

```tsx
import { Button } from '@snowye-ui/react';
const Page = () => {
  return <Button>I'm a button!</Button>;
};
```

<HeroContainer client:idle>
  <Button client:idle>I'm a button!</Button>
</HeroContainer>

## Props

The props will be shown as the example that follows.
Notice that in this example, the interface is extending ComponentProps of ButtonContainer, which is a radix-ui styled button, which can receive all props that a normal HTML button can, but can also receive all radix-ui props like `as` and `css`.

```tsx
interface ButtonProps extends ComponentProps<typeof ButtonContainer> {
  as?: ElementType; // Default: 'button';
  loading?: boolean; // Default: false;
  css?: CSS;
}
```

The css property works just like the radix-ui native property, but it also includes some additional properties, described at [Additional Styling](/en/overview/additional-styling)
